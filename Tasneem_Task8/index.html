                <div class="story_content">
                    <p>Once upon a time, high up in the sparkling night sky, there was a little star named Twinkle. Twinkle was smaller than the other stars and often felt lonely because she couldn’t shine as brightly.

                        One evening, the Moon noticed Twinkle’s sadness.
                        “Why are you so gloomy, little one?” the Moon asked.
                        “I wish I could be big and bright like the other stars,” Twinkle replied.
                        
                        The Moon smiled and said, “You may be small, but you have a special job. Would you like to help me guide a lost traveler on Earth?”
                        
                        Twinkle’s eyes lit up. “Really? What do I have to do?”
                        “Just follow me,” the Moon said, leading Twinkle across the night sky.
                        
                        Down on Earth, a little boy named Sami was walking through a dark forest. He had lost his way home and was feeling scared. Twinkle noticed his frightened face and decided to shine her very best.
                        
                        “Look, a star is lighting the way!” Sami said, following Twinkle’s glowing light. She twinkled brighter and brighter, leading Sami out of the forest and back to his cozy home.
                        
                        The boy waved at the sky and said, “Thank you, little star!”
                        
                        From that day on, Twinkle never felt small or unimportant. She realized that even a little light can make a big difference.
                        
                        And every night, Twinkle shone her brightest, ready for her next adventure.

                <div class="story_content">
                    <p>In a quiet pond surrounded by tall grass, there lived a little turtle named Timmy. Timmy was small and shy, and he was scared of everything—especially the dark.

                        One evening, a big storm rolled in. The wind howled, the rain poured, and the pond’s animals huddled together, afraid. Suddenly, they heard a tiny squeak.
                        “It’s Tommy the Frog!” someone cried. “He’s stuck in the reeds!”
                        
                        Everyone was too scared to go out into the storm, but Timmy took a deep breath.
                        “I’ll save him,” he said, surprising everyone.
                        
                        Slowly and carefully, Timmy paddled through the choppy water. The rain stung his shell, and the wind pushed him, but he kept going. When he reached Tommy, he said, “Hold onto my shell!”
                        
                        With all his might, Timmy swam back to the shore, where the other animals cheered. From that day on, Timmy wasn’t just a little turtle—he was the bravest turtle in the pond!

                <div class="story_content">
                    <p>Bella loved to paint. She painted flowers, trees, and her favorite animal—birds. But Bella's family was poor, and her old paintbrush was worn out.

                        One day, while walking in the forest, Bella found a shiny, golden paintbrush lying under a tree. “Who left this here?” she wondered, picking it up. As soon as she touched it, the paintbrush sparkled and whispered, “I’m magical! Whatever you paint will come to life.”
                        
                        Excited, Bella ran home and painted a basket of fresh apples. To her amazement, the apples jumped off the canvas, real and juicy! Bella used the paintbrush to help her family—painting food, clothes, and even fixing their old house.
                        
                        Soon, the greedy mayor heard about Bella’s magic paintbrush. He demanded she paint him gold and jewels. Bella didn’t want to, so she painted a bird to deliver a message to the king. The king arrived, praised Bella’s kindness, and made sure the mayor stopped bothering her.
                        
                        Bella continued using her magical paintbrush to help others, proving that kindness always wins.
